                            <p>I stepped out of my mom's womb on September 9th, 2016 to find a whole new world of flora and fauna. I had no clue what any of those meant and I used to listen and view in awe. I got introduced to my mom officially, though I had known her via her smell & touch. She was bubbling with emotions as she saw me for the first time and said it was worth the wait! Then I heard my dad cajoling me and taking me into his arms with pride. They looked so content with my arrival that they didnt even take their eyes off me for a minute. My grandma was happily watching us bond and when my mom and dad got busy she took me into her strong arms. I was so comfortable with her and felt an instant connection that I happily slept off in her arms.</p><p>A good nap was enough to greet my other relatives with smile. I was the center of attention and I had felt like everyone wanted to cuddle me. So much of love and happiness was swirling around that I was eagerly awaiting to know what was in store for me as my life unfolded each day!</p>
